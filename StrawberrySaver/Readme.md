  * This print will keep your strawberries out of the dirt and away from critters that want to eat them before you can!  
  * There are plenty of similar STL files online, however I wasn't fond of the overcomplicated nature of options currently available. I created this design to be really easy to print (upsidedown) without supports and still be functional.
  * Recommended Material: PETG (For outdoor applications). PLA is fine for indoor growing. Low-resolution is fine if you want to print faster.
  * Notes:
    * The "Whole-Circle" print should be placed before the plant gets too large.
    * If you have already begun to grow, you can print 2 of the "Half-Circle" options. The "Half-Circle" is also great for those of us with smaller 3D printers that would not fit hte entire cirlce.
    * I would not recommend much rescaling, as it is desgined to reach out to catch starwberries as the plant grows larger.  
HAPPY GROWING :sunny:  :leaves:

Note: The print in this image was scaled down slightly in CURA to fit on my printer.
